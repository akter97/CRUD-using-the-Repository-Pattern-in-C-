# RepositoryPaternCSHART
The repository pattern is a popular design pattern used in software development to separate the data access layer of an application from its business logic.
It is commonly used in object-oriented programming languages like C# to provide a layer of abstraction between the application code and the database.
In this project, we will create a simple console application using C# that implements 
the repository pattern to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database.
